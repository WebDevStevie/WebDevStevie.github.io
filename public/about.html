<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Steve and I am teaching myself to be a the best developer. Currently residing in Fort Lauderdale, FL I 
  love the sun, sand, and ocean. I enjoy being in a warm climate as it allows me to be out doors everyday and wear the Florida uniform;
  tee-shirt and shorts, everday!
</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Vienna, VA which is a stones throw to Washington D.C. our nations capitol. It was an amazing place to be
  raised as it allowed me to travel for school trips into D.C. often and learned a lot about our government. It is a beatiful city,
  full of plenty old architecture, monuments, and museums. I could not imagine a better childhood growing up with my 2 sisters and 
  going on tons of roadtrips almost making it to all 48 contiguous states.

<p>After graduating college with a BS in Business Information Technology I moved to Miami Florida to enjoy the year round warm
  weather and enjoy the close proximity to some of the best beaches in the U.S. I have lived in south Florida since 2011 and plan
  to stay in the state indefinitely as it is my favorite place to be!
